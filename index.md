<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Information Sciences](https://ischool.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://www.illinois.edu/). I am also affiliated with the [Siebel School of Computing and Data Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/), the [Coordinated Science Laboratory](https://csl.illinois.edu/), and the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/).

My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **machine learning** -- with a special focus on building intelligent visual systems that are continual and data-efficient. My research interests include **continual learning**, **few-shot learning**, **semi-supervised learning**, **generative models**, **3D geometry models**, and **medical imaging**.

Previously, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) and my BS in Electronic Information Engineering at [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm). I also spent time at [Johns Hopkins](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/), [Oxford VGG](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/), and [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/).
